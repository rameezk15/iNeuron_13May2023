    "Ans.<p>Let's simplify the explanation of <strong>Expression</strong> using cooking analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a <strong>dish (Expression)</strong>, we need a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>1. <strong>Ingredients (Values)</strong>: These are like the main components or ingredients we use in cooking. They can be numbers <code>1, 2, 3...</code> or words <code>\"hello\"</code> or even <code>true/false</code> statements. These ingredients form the basis of our dish.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>2. <strong>Utensils (Variables)</strong>: We need a container or utensil to store our ingredients. Variables act as these containers in programming. We give them names, like <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> and we can store values in them. These variables hold our ingredients for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>3. <strong>Recipe (Operators )</strong>: Now we need a recipe to combine the ingredients and create the dish. Operators act as these recipes in programming. They are symbols or keywords that perform specific operations on the ingredients. For example, the <code>+</code> operator is like an addition recipe, and the <code>-</code> operator is like a subtraction recipe. We can use different recipes to create different dishes (outputs) using the same ingredients.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>4. <strong>Recipe (Function call)</strong>: Now if we don't want to cook ourselves, we can buy ready-made food. It comes with all the ingredients(values) and preparations(operator & variable) done for us. We just need to heat it up in the oven or microwave (like calling a function) to make a dish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the examples you mentioned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>x = 2 + 3</code> : Here, the ingredients are the numbers 2 and 3. The <code>+</code> operator acts as the recipe to add them together. The output is 5, which is stored in the variable <code>x</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>x = 2 - 3</code> : In this case, the ingredients are still the numbers 2 and 3, but now the <code>-</code> operator is the recipe. The output is -1, which is stored in the variable <code>x</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding your example with boolean values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>x = false / true</code> : Here, we have the boolean values false and true as ingredients. The <code>/</code> operator represents division. However, when dividing booleans, they are implicitly converted to numerical values. In many programming languages, false is equivalent to 0 and true is equivalent to 1. So the output would be 0 divided by 1, which equals 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To summarize, <strong>expressions</strong> are like dishes created using ingredients (<code>values</code>), stored in utensils (<code>variables</code>), and combined with recipes (<code>operators & function call</code>) to produce different outputs. Each recipe (<code>operator & function call</code>) can yield a different dish (output) even with the same ingredients(<code>values</code>)."

    "\n",
    "<p>2. <strong>Statement</strong>: On the other hand, a statement is like a complete instruction or action in a program. It does something or controls the flow of the program. For example, <code>spam = 10</code> is a statement that assigns the value 10 to the variable `spam`. It doesn't give a result but changes the value stored in <code>spam</code>.\n",
